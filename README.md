# Mastermind 

In my first year with Nathan, we created a Mastermind game on Lazarus using Pascal code language. We are not allowed to build with an interface so we had to make it with the console.

To make our work easier, we decided to not put duplicates, and when you play as a decoder, you have to indicate each number if it's your code, or if it's your code and well placed. 

You can download the Mastermind.exe and try it ! Thnak you !
